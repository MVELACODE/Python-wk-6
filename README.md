## Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on data analysis and visualization using Python. The tasks involve loading and exploring a dataset, performing basic data analysis, and creating visualizations to gain insights from the data.

### Tasks

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**:
   - Load a dataset from a CSV file.
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Explore the structure of the dataset using `info()` and check for missing values.
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**:
   - Compute basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
   - Perform groupings and compute the mean of a numerical column grouped by a categorical column.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create various visualizations to analyze the data:
     - Line chart
     - Bar chart
     - Histogram
     - Scatter plot

### Requirements

- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

- **Dataset**:
  - Replace `your_dataset.csv` with the path to your dataset.
  - Update placeholder column names (e.g., `your_categorical_column`, `your_numerical_column`) with actual column names from your dataset.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
